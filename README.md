# Inspect Statblock

A Foundry VTT module that displays creature statblocks in a custom floating window with real-time updates. No more repetitive stat recitations—your players can view the creature's stats at a glance. Passive features provide interactive tooltips, and multiple statblocks can remain open between scenes. Press **Alt+I** to close all open windows.

Coffee helps me stay up to 2am to write these modules. Thank you for supporting the sleepless nights!
