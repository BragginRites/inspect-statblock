If you're sick of telling your players the stats of a creature that they would look up anyway, this module is for you.
This module displays a creature's statblock in a custom floating window with real-time updates. If CR is unknown, it shows "Player Character." Passive features display authentic Foundry item sheet tooltips on hover. Clicking the creature name toggles a pop-out portrait that automatically scales to fit the statblock's height. Users can open multiple statblocks, and pressing Alt+I closes all open windows.

## Features

1. **Multiple Windows**: Each actor gets its own statblock window.
2. **Alt+I**: Close all open statblock windows.
3. **Player Character Support**: Shows level and class information for PCs (including multiclass).
4. **Remember Window Position**: Saved per actor.
5. **Dark Theme**, draggable windows
6. **Defense Grid**: Clear display of resistances, immunities, vulnerabilities and condition immunities.
7. **Passive Features**: Interactive tooltips for passive abilities.
