If you're sick of telling your players the stats of a creature that they would look up anyway, this module is for you.
This module displays a creature's statblock in a custom floating window with real-time updates. Passive features display item sheet tooltips on hover. Users can open multiple statblocks, persisting on screen between scenes.
Pressing Alt+I closes all open windows.

Coffee helps me stay up to 2am to write these modules.
